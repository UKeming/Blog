                                    This is a tower defense game , completely done in Java . Some basic program logic is used in it. It is my first programming project. I did it almost by myself.

                                    A portal-like game where players can place multiple portals on the map,
                                    which can transport bullets, enemies, and players.
                                    The game was developed by UE4 and I completed 80% of the blueprint part.
                                    The model part was done by the rest of the group,
                                    but the game ended up being a half-finished game due to the poor quality of the models.
                                    But nevertheless, I like the game very much.
                                    I specially developed a server and database for this game to store
                                    the player pass time ranking.

                                    I built the VPN server using Vmess,
                                    and a VPN homepage. On this homepage,
                                    users can log in. After successful login,
                                    users can download the VPN description file to download the VPN.
                                    The project is complete, but it has not been released or used, just for personal practice.
