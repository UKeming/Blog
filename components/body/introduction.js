                        In addition to these programming languages, I learned a lot of very important programming ideas. I believe that ideas are the only basis on which computer science can be built up.                        <br />

<br />
                        <br />
                        After that, when I realized that I already had some basic computer skills, I started to find new things to learn on my own.
                        For example, after I took CS1410, CS2420, which are introductory computer
                        classes, I had some programming skills,
                        but this ability was limited to writing some local simple stand-alone programs.
                        I then became curious about how to write a program that could be networked.
                        So, in 2022, when I returned to China for COVID-19 and took a year off from
                        school, I started to learn a lot about servers and clients, and database
                        operations. I learned html, css, js, docker, spring-boot and so on.
                        And in that year, I successfully developed the back-end of a courier
                        pickup program. And a backend for a hotel booking platform.
                        But despite this, I was still not satisfied with only writing back-end,
                        so I started to understand a series of front-end knowledge,
                        although not particularly systematic learning, but also let me have a certain
                        understanding of the full-stack development.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Now, I'm still learning new things, too. 
                        I'm trying to understand how everything works instead of just learning the technology itself. 
                        I enjoy the feeling of clearing the fog.

                        I was born on November 12, 1999. I am 23 years old. Currently attending the University of Utah.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        I am a boy who loves technology and loves to explore.
                        From a young age I have had a keen interest in computers.
                        After my compulsory education in China ended, I officially started to learn about computer technology. I first bought a book called C Premier Plus and taught myself C. This was my programming initiation book. After that, I came to the University of Utah. While I was at the university, I took every course seriously and learned many other skills such as Java, C#, and C++.

                                    A portal-like game where players can place multiple portals on the map,
                                    which can transport bullets, enemies, and players.
                                    The game was developed by UE4 and I completed 80% of the blueprint part.
                                    The model part was done by the rest of the group,
                                    but the game ended up being a half-finished game due to the poor quality of the models.
                                    But nevertheless, I like the game very much.
                                    I specially developed a server and database for this game to store
                                    the player pass time ranking.

                                    This is a team project and I am in charge of the back-end of the hotel reservation system.
                                    Responsible for writing the database structure, as well as the server,
                                    to ensure that there will be no problems with hotel reservations.

                                    I built the VPN server using Vmess,
                                    and a VPN homepage. On this homepage,
                                    users can log in. After successful login,
                                    users can download the VPN description file to download the VPN.
                                    The project is complete, but it has not been released or used, just for personal practice.

                                    to write programs, and the characters in the game will run according
                                    to the program. Players need to write different programs to complete
                                    different levels. I was in charge of the program editor part of this project.
