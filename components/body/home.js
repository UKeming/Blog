                        In addition to these programming languages, I learned a lot of very important programming ideas. I believe that ideas are the only basis on which computer science can be built up.                        <br />

<br />
                        <br />
                        After that, when I realized that I already had some basic computer skills, I started to find new things to learn on my own.
                        For example, after I took CS1410, CS2420, which are introductory computer
                        classes, I had some programming skills,
                        but this ability was limited to writing some local simple stand-alone programs.
                        I then became curious about how to write a program that could be networked.
                        So, in 2022, when I returned to China for COVID-19 and took a year off from
                        school, I started to learn a lot about servers and clients, and database
                        operations. I learned html, css, js, docker, spring-boot and so on.
                        And in that year, I successfully developed the back-end of a courier
                        pickup program. And a backend for a hotel booking platform.
                        But despite this, I was still not satisfied with only writing back-end,
                        so I started to understand a series of front-end knowledge,
                        although not particularly systematic learning, but also let me have a certain
                        understanding of the full-stack development.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Now, I'm still learning new things, too. 
                        I'm trying to understand how everything works instead of just learning the technology itself. 
                        I enjoy the feeling of clearing the fog.
